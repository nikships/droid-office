// The WebXR session: rig, controller/hand input, and locomotion for the headset browser.
// Plain Three.js WebXR (renderer.xr + setAnimationLoop).
//
// Hands speak pinch: three forwards the runtime's select events plus its own joint-distance
// pinchstart/pinchend to the target-ray spaces, and the session reads their union as one
// held state per hand — a tap is E, a hold is a teleport aim, both hands together open the
// menu (both-held suppresses aiming, so the menu gesture stays reachable). Controllers keep
// their instant trigger (they have A for teleport, squeeze for menu).
//
// The ladder and the poles work too: the desktop update that steps them never runs in VR, so
// the session steps the rig itself, with the glide stick working the rungs and E letting go.
//
// The rig is the standard three dolly: the desktop camera is reparented under a Group at the
// avatar's feet while presenting, and three composes the headset pose with it
// (WebXRManager.updateCamera). The avatar (player.pos) stays the source of truth: VR locomotion
// moves it through the same collision as walking, the desktop move sender picks it up unchanged,
// and anything desktop-side that moves the player (N, the elevator, ladders) rebases the rig.
