# Client

- This directory is the Vite root; the config is the repository root's `vite.config.ts`. An HTML page ships only if it is listed in `build.rollupOptions.input` there; unlisted pages such as `vr-preview.html` exist only under the dev server.
- `tsconfig.client.json` (Bundler resolution, DOM lib, no Node types) typechecks this directory. Relative imports have no extension.
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and `vite.config.mjs` here are detection shims for the IWSDK CLI. Never add dependencies to them; dependencies go in the root `package.json`. The shim's only dependency is the `@iwsdk/cli` pin, which must equal the root lockfile's version (`tests/iwsdk-shim.test.ts`). After bumping `@iwsdk/cli` at the root, set the same version here and run `npm install --package-lock-only` in this directory.
- Keep modules that `tests/` imports (for example `vr/math.ts`, `world/office.ts`, `player.ts`) loadable in Node: no DOM or WebGL access at import time.

## WebXR and the IWSDK runtime

Read [docs/vr-webxr.md](../../docs/vr-webxr.md) before changing `vr/` or VR hooks in `main.ts`.

`npm run dev:runtime` (from the repository root) serves the office with an emulated Quest 3 and a headless managed browser at `https://127.0.0.1:5173`. It proxies `/api` and `/ws` to an office on `https://localhost:4600`, so start one over HTTPS first, e.g. `node bin/droid-office.js <project> --self-signed`. The emulator test hooks load with `?vrtest=1` (`window.__vrtest`).

`iwsdk-scripts/*.mjs` are Playwright scripts for that browser, each exporting a default `run({ frame, page, ... })`. With the runtime up, run one from the repository root:

```bash
npx --no-install @iwsdk/cli browser run src/client/iwsdk-scripts/<script>.mjs --workspace src/client
```

Stop it with `npx --no-install @iwsdk/cli dev down --workspace src/client` or by ending the `npm run dev:runtime` process.

## Native Galaxy XR adapter

Read [the native design and evidence](../../docs/vr-native-android.md) before changing `native/`
or its hooks in `main.ts`; `/?native=1` keeps the original scene, gameplay, windows and server
protocol while the installed OpenXR app draws the world. Native controller input must not
change the desktop or WebXR control schemes. Panel layout rules and browser check sizes are
in [vr-native-ui-polish.md](../../docs/vr-native-ui-polish.md).

Read [the controller interaction contract](../../docs/vr-native-controller-interactions.md) before
changing native buttons, physical grabs, climbing or the gun. Preserve shared Climber floor
travel and shot confirmations; scene cleanup must not abort a pending climb arrival.

Use `headsetActive()` / `headsetControls()` for gameplay guards shared by WebXR and native
XR. Desktop walking paths do not advance while native controls own the avatar; palette
actions must follow the existing headset action path instead of waiting for desktop walking.

Native single-choice dropdowns use `native/select.ts` so all choices stay on the compositor
panel. Preserve the original select and its input/change listeners; Android's separate popup
window cannot use the panel's forwarded controller pointer events.
